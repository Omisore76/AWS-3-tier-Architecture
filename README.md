# AWS-3-tier-Architecture
Building a secure, scalable, highly-available, and modular architecture.

AWS 3-tier architecture is a logical and physical structure that separates your application into three tiers: the web, the application, and the database. By separating your application into these three tiers, you can create a scalable and highly available architecture that can be easily implemented using AWS services.

The web tier: handles incoming HTTP requests from clients and delivers static content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

The application tier: is responsible for processing dynamic requests from clients and interacting with the database to retrieve or update data.

The database tier: is responsible for storing data in a durable and scalable way.

If you're looking to implement the AWS 3-tier architecture in your own cloud environment, be sure to check out the article I wrote on it. In the article, I go over all the key components of the architecture and how to set it up. I also provide some tips on how to optimize it for your specific needs. By following the steps in the article, you'll be able to quickly and easily get your AWS 3-tier architecture up and running.
